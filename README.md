# Curvy

**Define and access Cubic Bezier Splines**

Stitch together one or more Cubic BÃ©zier curves into a spline, then use the spline for interpolation, lookup, or
anything else!

## Features

* **Intuitive Definition**: An array of 2D points define the curves
* **Easy Access**: Solve the curve at a position along the curve, or from either axis
* **Useful Metadata**: Get the monotonicity along each axis, the bounding box, and the extrema along the curve
